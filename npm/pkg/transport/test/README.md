# Test Server streaming using gRPC

The sample program starts a server streaming and client gRPC service. The server runs as a go routine listening on port 8080 while the client loops forever receiving a stream of messages from the server after a connection has been established (initiated by the client by sending the client ID through an RPC call).

The client logs the recieved stream of messages to the console.

## Running the program

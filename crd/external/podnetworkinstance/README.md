Pod Network Instance (PNI)

PNIs represent optional requirements, or behavior configurations for how we setup the pod networking. They should map 1:1 and follow the lifetime of a customer workload.

The object points to the PN for the delegated subnet to use and defines allocation requirements (e.g.: for IPs to reserve for pod endpoints). Orchestrator RP will map the deployments with these requirements to the PNI object through labels on the pod spec pointing to this object identifier.Â

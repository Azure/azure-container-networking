List of included CRDs

# PodNetwork (PN)

This CRD is added to enable VNET multitenancy – which will be watched and managed by the control plane.

PodNetwork objects need to be created by Orchestrator in the subnet delegation flow.
These represent a Cx subnet already delegated by the customer to the Orchestrator and locked with a Service Association Link (SAL) on network RP.

# WorkloadNetworkConfig (WNC)

WNCs represent optional requirements, or behavior configurations for how we setup the pod networking. They should map 1:1 and follow the lifetime of a customer workload.

The object points to the PodNetwork for the delegated subnet to use and defines allocation requirements (e.g.: for IPs to reserve for pod endpoints). Orchestrator can map the deployments with these requirements to the WNC object through labels on the pod spec pointing to this object identifier.
